          <p>
            Yadukul Dairy began with a simple yet powerful vision: to bridge the gap between rural purity and urban demand. Born from generations of dairy farming heritage in the heartland of Uttar Pradesh, we saw a need for milk that was not just fresh, but also trustworthy and handled with the utmost care.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            We started small, with a handful of our best-bred cows and a commitment to ethical, sustainable farming. Our journey from a local village farm to a trusted name in Noida is a testament to our unwavering focus on quality. We believe that the best dairy products come from happy animals and a clean environment, a principle that guides us every single day.
